## Objective

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a powerful tool for analytics with strong support for managing data, exploring statistical models, and visualizing results. This session is designed to introduce the many components of R and describe why you should consider adding them to your toolkit. Subsequent sessions could provide technical details and examples of using R for the three major components of any analysis: data, models, and presentation.

## Outline

1. What is R?
2. Benefits of R
3. Caveats when using R (especially in the OPS)
4. Setting up an R-based toolkit on an OPS computer
5. Case study: Analyzing population projections

## Audience

The session is for anyone curious about R or keen on enhancing their analytics toolbox. Intermediate and advanced R users might learn a couple of new tricks, but the session is targeted to beginners.
